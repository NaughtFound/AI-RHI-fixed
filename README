# Deep Active Inference of rubber-hand Illusion

AI-RHI-fixed is a project that focuses on the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) using Active Inference (AI). This project is based on the [active-inference-rhi](https://github.com/mgh5225/active-inference-rhi) repository.

## Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI)

The Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) is a perceptual illusion where a person feels that a fake hand is part of their own body. This is typically achieved by providing synchronous visual and tactile stimulation to the person's real hand and the fake hand. The AI-RHI-fixed project aims to investigate and model the RHI using Active Inference principles.

## Active Inference (AI)

Active Inference is a unifying framework for perception, action, and cognition based on the Free Energy Principle. It provides a general approach to understanding and modeling the dynamics of living systems, including the emergence of the RHI.
